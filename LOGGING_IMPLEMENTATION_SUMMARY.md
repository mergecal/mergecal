## Logging Patterns Used

### Pattern 1: Category: Action - Details
```python
logger.info("Calendar merge: SUCCESS - calendar=%s, size=%d bytes, duration=%.2fs", ...)
```

### Pattern 2: Performance Tracking
```python
import time
start_time = time.time()
# ... operation ...
duration = time.time() - start_time
logger.info("Operation: Complete - duration=%.2fs", duration)
```

### Pattern 3: Both Paths (Success/Failure)
```python
try:
    result = operation()
    logger.info("Operation: SUCCESS - details=%s", details)
except Exception as e:
    logger.error("Operation: FAILED - error=%s, error_type=%s", str(e), type(e).__name__)
    raise
```

### Pattern 4: Rich Context
```python
logger.info(
    "Event: Action - key1=%s, key2=%s, key3=%s",
    value1,
    value2,
    value3,
)
```

INFO Auth: User login - username=john, email=john@example.com, tier=free, ip=192.168.1.1
```

### Cache Operations
```
INFO Signal: Source created - source=Work Cal, url=https://..., calendar=My Cal, owner=john

## Testing the Logging

To verify the logging is working:

```bash
# 1. Run the development server with verbose logging
python manage.py runserver --verbosity=3

# 2. Create a calendar and watch the logs
# You should see:
# - Validation logs
# - Creation logs
# - Signal logs
# - Cache invalidation logs

# 3. Access a calendar
# You should see:
# - Access logs with user agent/IP
# - Merge process logs
# - Source fetch logs
# - Performance metrics

# 4. Check Celery logs
celery -A config.celery_app worker -l info
# You should see detailed task execution logs
```

## Conclusion

The logging implementation is comprehensive and production-ready. It provides:

✅ **Complete visibility** into system operations
✅ **Rich context** for debugging and analysis
✅ **Performance metrics** for optimization
✅ **Business intelligence** for decision making
✅ **Security monitoring** for threat detection
✅ **Operational metrics** for SLA tracking

Every meaningful operation now tells its story through logs.
