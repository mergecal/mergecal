        <strong>Part 1: MergeCal Caching</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        MergeCal caches calendar data to enhance performance and load times. The cache is set to refresh every 24 hours; however, it is immediately cleared when any modifications are made on the site. This ensures that any changes you make are reflected in MergeCal without delay.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Part 2: Google Calendar Caching</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Google Calendar may take up to 24 hours to reflect changes as it periodically updates external calendars. Google also caches these calendars, which means even immediate changes on MergeCal might not appear in your Google Calendar until the next sync cycle. Please allow some time for these updates to be fully visible.
