            </p>
            <h2 class="mt-4">WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?</h2>
            <p>
              This Privacy Policy covers Company's treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that Company gathers when you access the Website and when you use Company's calendar merging services. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Company does not own or control, or to individuals that Company does not employ or manage.
            </p>
            <h2 class="mt-4">WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES COMPANY COLLECT?</h2>
            <p>
              The information we gather from customers enables us to personalize and improve our services, and allows our users to set up a user account and profile that can be used to utilize our calendar merging services. We collect the following types of information from our customers:
            </p>
            <h3>Personal Information You Provide to Us:</h3>
            <p>
              We receive and store any information you enter on our Website or provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected may include your name, email address, IP address, browser information, username, password, calendar data, and any other information necessary for us to provide our services. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as answering questions, improving the content of the Website, customizing the advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about Company's products and services, including specials and new features.
            </p>
            <h3>Personal Information Collected Automatically:</h3>
            <ul>

Company automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, browser information, operating system, timestamps, and the page you requested.
              </li>
              <li>
                Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Website and its components. Company only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Website or services so that we can make the Website appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our Website or services. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use the Website or services, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. Company never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>E-mail Communications:</h3>
            <p>

            </p>

              <li>
